What is a Server:

A server is a computer or system that provides services to other computers or clients (users) over a network.
Role of the Domain Name:

The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address. It provides a user-friendly way to access the website.
Type of DNS Record for www.foobar.com:

The DNS record for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing to the domain itself.
Role of the Web Server:

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Role of the Application Server:

The application server processes dynamic content, executes the application code, and communicates with the database to generate responses to user requests.
Role of the Database:

MySQL stores and manages the website's data, including user information, content, and other relevant information.
Server Communication with User's Computer:

The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, delivering web pages and data in response to user requests.
Issues with this Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes unavailable. To address this, consider introducing redundancy, load balancing, or a failover system.
Downtime during Maintenance:

When deploying new code or performing maintenance, the web server often needs to be restarted, causing downtime. Implementing techniques like rolling deployments or using a secondary server can help minimize downtime.
Limited Scalability:

With only one server, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a large volume of incoming traffic. Scaling options like load balancing, horizontal scaling (adding more servers), or utilizing cloud services should be considered for improved scalability.

Why Web Server?

Separating the web server from the application server enables the efficient handling of static content, enhancing performance and scalability. It also simplifies the overall architecture by segregating responsibilities.
Why Application Server?

The application server hosts and executes the core business logic of the application. By separating it from the web server, you achieve a modular architecture that is easier to maintain, scale, and update independently.
Why Database Server?

A dedicated database server ensures that data storage and retrieval are handled independently of the application logic. This separation improves scalability, allows for specialized database optimizations, and simplifies maintenance.
Why Load Balancer (HAProxy)?

Load balancing distributes incoming traffic, preventing overload on a single server and improving performance. Configuring HAProxy as a cluster enhances reliability and fault tolerance, ensuring continuous service availability even if one load balancer fails.
Why Additional Server?

Adding an extra server enhances redundancy and fault tolerance. It provides a backup in case one server experiences issues, contributing to a more robust and reliable infrastructure.
